    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After months of hurdles and fuel crisis, weâ€™re finally continuing our monthly Ruby Meetup. Around 30 ruby enthusiasts showed up for the december meetup held on 20th December 2015. I was very glad and a little nervous to host the event for the very first time. I would like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/zoraslapen">Saroj</a> dai for providing me the opportunity to host the event.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/9/7/600_445174967.jpeg">http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/9/7/600_445174967.jpeg</a>"></p>

<p>First speaker was <a href="https://twitter.com/nivdul">Ludwine Probst</a>, data engineer from France. Despite having Mathematics as her academic background, she talked about how she is enjoying her career as a software developer. She also shared her experience as a developer in France. She explained her journey from France to Asian countries to know more about the woman involvement on IT world. Rather than a talk, it was an interactive session with the meetup participants.</p>

<p>Second speaker was <a href="https://twitter.com/gkunwar1">Ganesh Kunwar</a>, Sr. Ruby Developer from Jyaasa on the topic &ldquo;Test Driven Development(TDD Basics)&rdquo;. He briefly explained on how TDD can be practiced easily with gems like RSpec, Test/Unit, Capybara with some code samples. He shared his experience on TDD workflow on codebase. He shed some light on TDD (Test Driven Development) and DDT (Development Driven Test) approach which not only clarified the value of TDD in QC (Quality Control) but also significantly improving the overall architecture of the system design itself.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every year around the world there are ruby meetup and rails meetup happenings, so why not organise Ruby/Rails Meetup here at Kathmandu. This meetup will not be just an event but also be a point of unite and interaction and sharing of knowledge and experiences between the distributed ruby developers in kathmandu valley.</p>

<p>This will be a regular event happening once a month, to be specific; every second Sunday of the month starting August 9th, 2015.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CLoUmwqWIAAc9AR.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CLoUmwqWIAAc9AR.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>We want a lot of people and groups to be engaged to make this event success. Feel free to suggest us ideas and to come up forward.</p>

<p>And if you want to present or be a speaker at the meetup, you are most welcome and this is your time to send us details.</p>

<p>Thought about speaking? Want to give speaking at Ruby on Rails Meetup a shot, but not sure what to talk about?</p>

<p>Even if you have a tiny inkling that you&rsquo;d want to speak, like your experience, technology, tips and tricks, even maybe a tutorial, we&rsquo;ll help you to ideate, write and present.</p>

<p>Great business starts with unsurpassed people skills, it is a great oppurtunity for tech business houses to be promoted and find connections at the event. We welcome sponsorship of any kind financial, promotional, resources or even may be a service or server.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The tech scene in Kathmandu is ever growing but it is rather lacking a sense of community. Dev Meetup aims to fill this void with a regular meetup for developers where like minded individuals can gather, get to know each other and share their ideas/views.</p>

<p>The meetup will be carried out monthly (last Saturday of the month) to cover web development topics like &lsquo;ruby&rsquo;, &lsquo;rails&rsquo;, &lsquo;javascript&rsquo;, &lsquo;devops&rsquo;, &lsquo;databases&rsquo;, etc.</p>

<p>The first successful <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/768447783198796/">Dev Meetup</a> was held on July 26, 2014 at CloudFactory, the next Dev Meetup is scheduled for August 30th, 2014 at the same venue.</p>
