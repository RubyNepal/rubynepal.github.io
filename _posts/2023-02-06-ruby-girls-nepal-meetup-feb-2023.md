Hello everyone!
As we all know, there is a Ruby community here in Nepal which hosts amazing meetups every month. But did you know that we also have a Rails Girls community? It is a community to encourage and empower women in Ruby in Nepal. It has been dormant for quite some time but it's high time we REVIVE it!

We know, we know! Reviving and growing a community is a LOT of work. Let's start easy by getting to know each other first. We have planned a small coffee meetup on 25th February to meet the awesome ladies that are actively working with Ruby here in Nepal. Let's meet, grab some coffee, talk about what is happening in tech and Ruby, and share our experiences.
