The tech scene in Kathmandu is ever growing but it is rather lacking a sense of community. Dev Meetup aims to fill this void with a regular meetup for developers where like minded individuals can gather, get to know each other and share their ideas/views.

The meetup will be carried out monthly (last Saturday of the month) to cover web development topics like 'ruby', 'rails', 'javascript', 'devops', 'databases', etc.

The first successful [Dev Meetup](https://www.facebook.com/events/768447783198796/) was held on July 26, 2014 at CloudFactory, the next Dev Meetup is scheduled for August 30th, 2014 at the same venue.

Sign up at https://plus.google.com/events/cr78vpsi1466vv0ldj990fdgdr8 to join us. Kudos to CloudFactory for sponsoring both the events.
