**<span>Never heard of Ruby? Eager to start learning Rails? Freshers/Juniors or Seniors; all are expected to show up at the event where all levels of conversation/ideas/views are discussed.</span>**

People at the meetup are _**[MINASWAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINASWAN)**_ (friendly, helpful and nice) so don't hesitate to ask/share anything as we are open-source minded. If there's any topic you think should be covered at the meetup event then please let us know by [adding/opening](https://github.com/RubyNepal/rorh/issues/new) issues at [https://github.com/RubyNepal/rorh/issues](https://github.com/RubyNepal/rorh/issues).&nbsp;
_Fancy speaking in front of others?_ then do [add](https://github.com/RubyNepal/rorh/issues/new) your title there-in as well.

**_Want to present and can't find a title?_**
Even better option is to pick one up from the [issue&nbsp;list](https://github.com/RubyNepal/rorh/issues) or [add](https://github.com/RubyNepal/rorh/issues/new) your own presentation title, challenge yourself (or dare your friend) to&nbsp;give a talk & prove yourself&nbsp;to&nbsp;<span>get featured on </span>[RubyNepal blog](https://www.rubynepal.org/blog/) and <span>add that to your resume</span>.

<span>**For SPONSORS**</span>

<span><span>Sponsors make it possible to organize these events which uplift and promote the ruby community activities. </span>Any Company/Person/Group can come upfront to <span>volunteer at the event or </span>**sponsor**_venue space, snacks (tea/coffee), cash, rubynepal goodies, etc_. Sponsor logo will be advertised and circulated in the meetup banner image along with a "**Thank you**" note.</span>
