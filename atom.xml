    <id>http://RubyNepal.github.io/blog/2016/01/12/ruby-meetup-january-2016</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year to all the Rubyists out there from RubyNepal.org. A common way to celebrate new year is by revisiting moments from your past, so I decided to conduct the first edition of the year 2016&rsquo;s monthly Ruby and Rails Meetup at CloudFactory. It was nostaligic for me to go back to the place from where I learnt so much and is filled with so many good memories.</p>

<p>As for the meetup itself, two presentation talks were given during the event held on Jan 10th, for which around 35 developers turned up.</p>

<p>The first talk was titled &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/RubyNepal/rorh/issues/9">Performance Improvement of Rails Application</a>&rdquo; by <a href="https://twitter.com/sadikshagautam">Sadiksha Gautam</a>. She is currently working as Software Developer at EnerNOC, a Ruby on Rails based company in Munich, Germany and was eager to share her experience even before she arrived back to Nepal.</p>

<p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/8/a/600_445784938.jpeg"></p>

<p>Some good tips on profiling, caching and optimization were shared along with her <a href="http://files.meetup.com/18762323/Performance_Improvement_Sadiksha_Gautam-Ruby_Nepal_Meetup-Jan_10.pdf">slides</a> which you can sneak into your Rails app and claim your performance bonus raise. Kudos to Sadiksha for giving the presentation while being unwell. Get well soon!</p>

<p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/a/0/0/600_445787616.jpeg"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> is new rage in the developer universe and DevOps Manager, Bikash Kaji Basukala wasn&rsquo;t far behind. He showed all the tricks he had pulled off with tools like Docker, Jenkins CI, Github APIs and Hipchat to automate and scale the ever-growing CloudFactory, a Ruby on Rails startup enterprise from Nepal to millions of users around the world.</p>

<p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/b/4/600_445784980.jpeg"></p>

<p>Too bad if you missed this <strong>advanced talk</strong> as some serious <em>Q&amp;A</em> took place afterwards which was rather informative to anyone who is facing problem scaling apps from monolith to SOA to microservices. Checkout the cool diagrams from his <a href="https://bit.ly/scaling_ci_with_dockers">slides</a> of &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/RubyNepal/rorh/issues/12">Scaling CI with Docker @ CloudFactory</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/f/9/highres_445785049.jpeg"></p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard then we <a href="https://rubynepal-slack.herokuapp.com/">hangout</a> on <a href="https://rubynepal.slack.com/">Slack</a> and use github issues to schedule and manage our meetup presentations. You can pick/open <a href="https://github.com/RubyNepal/rorh/issues">issue</a> if you want to share your experience or want others to present on topic that intrests you.</p>

<p>Meetup attendees thank <a href="https://twitter.com/bibstha">Bibek Shrestha</a> from Austria for the wonderful stickers all the way from <a href="http://confreaks.tv/events/rubyconf2015">RubyConf 2015 (Texas, US)</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/c/0/600_445480640.jpeg"></p>

<p>Also, warm greetings to <a href="http://www.cloudfactory.com/home">CloudFactory</a> for allowing us to use the spacious training hall and snacks for the event. Like it&rsquo;s said, &ldquo;One step into the past, one into the future&rdquo;. Both speakers happen to be my good old #RubyFriends and it was good to see some old faces! So, don&rsquo;t forget your friends and take care of your family.</p>

<p>Have a great year ahead and see you at the next <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Nepal-Ruby-Users-Group/">Ruby and Rails meetup</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After months of hurdles and fuel crisis, we’re finally continuing our monthly Ruby Meetup. Around 30 ruby enthusiasts showed up for the december meetup held on 20th December 2015. I was very glad and a little nervous to host the event for the very first time. I would like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/zoraslapen">Saroj</a> dai for providing me the opportunity to host the event.</p>

<p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/9/7/600_445174967.jpeg"></p>

<p>First speaker was <a href="https://twitter.com/nivdul">Ludwine Probst</a>, data engineer from France. Despite having Mathematics as her academic background, she talked about how she is enjoying her career as a software developer. She also shared her experience as a developer in France. She explained her journey from France to Asian countries to know more about the woman involvement on IT world. Rather than a talk, it was an interactive session with the meetup participants.</p>

<p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/9/d/f/600_445315775.jpeg"></p>

<p>Second speaker was <a href="https://twitter.com/gkunwar1">Ganesh Kunwar</a>, Sr. Ruby Developer from Jyaasa on the topic &ldquo;Test Driven Development(TDD Basics)&rdquo;. He briefly explained on how TDD can be practiced easily with gems like RSpec, Test/Unit, Capybara with some code samples. He shared his experience on TDD workflow on codebase. He shed some light on TDD (Test Driven Development) and DDT (Development Driven Test) approach which not only clarified the value of TDD in QC (Quality Control) but also significantly improving the overall architecture of the system design itself. You can download the  slides <a href="http://files.meetup.com/18762323/Test%20Driven%20Development%20%28TDD%29%20-%20Ruby%20Nepal%20Meetup%20-%20Dec%2020%2C2015.pdf">here</a></p>

<p>A big thank you to <a href="http://www.cloudfactory.com/home">CloudFactory</a> for sponsoring December RubyNepal Meetup and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IHKathmandu">Innovation Hub Kathmandu</a> for the awesome venue.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The monthly Ruby Meetup was held on the 2nd Sunday of September last week. Local ruby enthusiasts came together to quench and moreover arouse appetite for learning.</p>

<p>Two presentations were given during the meetup. First was a follow-up of our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Nepal-Ruby-Users-Group/events/224417878/">last meetup</a> on front-end development; <strong>Asset Management in Rails</strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/josisusan"><em>Susan Joshi</em></a>. Things got serious when <a href="https://twitter.com/prasvinp"><em>Prasvin Pandey</em></a> steered ahead to dive into <strong>MetaProgramming in Ruby</strong>. Gladly no-one dozed off as things got pretty cozy.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can download the slides and example codes from <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Nepal-Ruby-Users-Group/files/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>A big shout out to our sponsors for the September event. <a href="mailto:rubynepal.org@gmail.com">Get in touch</a> if you or your company wants to sponsor and promote the event in future.</p>

<p>1) <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IHKathmandu">Innovation Hub Kathmandu</a> for graciously allowing us to use the venue.</p>

<p>2) <a href="http://leapfrog.academy/courses_ror.php">Leapfrog.Academy</a> who are currently teaching a course on <em>Web Development with Ruby on Rails</em>.</p>

<p>3) <a href="http://codysseynepal.com/">Codyssey Web Nepal</a>, a RoR dev shop.</p>

<p>In a true developer fashion, going forward we&rsquo;ll be using github to manage meetup presentations. You can go ahead and open issues in <a href="https://github.com/RubyNepal/rorh/issues">https://github.com/RubyNepal/rorh/issues</a> for:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Either something you want to present on</p></li>
<li><p>Show off what you have built or working on</p></li>
<li><p>Things you want to learn about</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I overheard there was an inspiring entrepreneur speech involved during the networking session at the end. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Nepal-Ruby-Users-Group/photos/26406995/">Picture proofs</a></p>

<p>See you at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Nepal-Ruby-Users-Group/">next Ruby and Rails meetup</a>!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is not another getting started with octopress guide, this is sharing of our experience and couple of hacks we did while developing rubynepal, that may be helpful to others.</p>

<p>In the beginning of June 2013, We came up with this idea of building a community website for ruby developers of nepal.
We didn&rsquo;t need to have a full content management features but we needed features like blog support, pages support, ease for deployments and easy contributing mechanism. Finally, we decided to build rubynepal.org with <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a> and github pages. With this we could to tap out Markdown without needing a web-based WYSIWYG editor and type a command to send everything up to the free Github Pages service and our whole website would be a github repo, perfect for collaboration.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">docs</a> has pretty neat documentation for installing octopress, configuring setting up github pages. Within few minutes basic website was up at github pages.</p>

<p>Next, themes, we forked this beautiful and responsive theme <a href="https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade">greyshade</a> and customized it. Upto here we had a basic rubynepal.org up and running.</p>

<p>Now, octopress has its root path that displays the posts ie. essentially blog index, but we needed to have a page instead of blog index.
For this, first we moved <em>source/index.html</em> to <em>source/blog/index.html</em>. Then, created a markdown where we wrote what is to be there in homepage.
We put all such kinds of markdown inside <em>_partial</em> folder.
Then, in <em>source/index.html</em> we got rid of all exsiting code with</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>  ---
</span><span class='line'>  layout: default
</span><span class='line'>  ---
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;page_about&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    {% render_partial _partial/about.markdown %}
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This way about.markdown will be rendered in root page while blog index will be available at <em>/blog</em>.</p>

<p>Now we had to put a list of developers and advisors info in members page. One way was to dump those info to a yml file and access data from there. Matt Swanson has excellent write on how to do that in his <a href="http://mdswanson.com/blog/2013/06/03/jekyll-201.html">blog</a>. With this, we could dump the data from yml file to jekyll <em>site</em> variable.</p>

<p>Finally, we built a small heroku app that powers the join page forms and we have rubynepal.org as how it is now.</p>
